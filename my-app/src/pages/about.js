        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I'm Mandy Chang, currently immersed in the challenging yet rewarding world of a web development bootcamp. My journey into full-stack web development is fueled by a passion for creating and a drive to solve real-world problems through code.
        Before embarking on this exciting path, I found myself fascinated by the endless possibilities that coding and web development offer. The idea of building applications from scratch, bringing ideas to life, and impacting users' lives positively has always intrigued me. This curiosity led me to join a rigorous bootcamp, where I am honing my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies.
        In this intensive program, I'm learning a wide array of languages and tools including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, and more. Each day presents new challenges and learning opportunities, and I'm embracing them wholeheartedly. My portfolio is a testament to my growth, showcasing projects that range from simple web designs to complex, dynamic web applications.
